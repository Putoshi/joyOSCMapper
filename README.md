# joyOSCMapper
**joyOSCMapper** is an easy way to visualize and map your joycon inputs (buttons, stick and motion) as [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) messages. It is built in C++/[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) and uses the [JoyShockLibrary](https://github.com/JibbSmart/JoyShockLibrary) to gather the data from the joycons via Bluetooth and the *ofxOsc* addon to convert the data in OSC messages.
